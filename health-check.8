.SH NAME
health-check \- a tool to measure system events.
.br

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B health-check
.RI [options]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
Health-check monitors a process and optionally their child
processes and threads for a given amount of time.  At the end
of the monitoring it will display the CPU time used, wakeup
events generated and I/O operations of the given processes.
It can be used to diagnose unhealthy badly behaving processes.
.SH OPTIONS
health-check options are as follow:
.TP
.B \-h
Show help
.TP
.B \-b
Brief (terse) output for quick overview.
.TP
.B \-c 
Find and monitor all child and threads of a given set of processes. This
option is only useful when attaching to already running processes using
the \-p option.
.TP
.B \-d 
Specify analysis duration in seconds. Default is 60 seconds.  A duration
of 0 will make health-check run forever, or until the monitored process
exits.
.TP
.B \-f
Follow fork, vfork and clone system calls.
.TP
.B \-p pid[,pid]
Specify which processes to analyse. Can be process ID or process name.
.TP
.B \-r
Resolve IP addresses, this can take some time, hence it is an opt-in
feature.
.TP
.B \-m max
Specify maximum number of timeout blocking system calls are logged
before completing. This is useful with very busy processes that can
generate tens of thousands of ptrace events that have to be logged by
health-check. The default is 1 million.
.TP
.B \-o logfile
Specify output log file to export JSON formatted results.  The resulting
data can be then easily imported and analysed using JSON parsing tools.
.TP
.B \-u username
Run command as the specified user.  This cannot be used with the \-p option.
.TP
.B \-v verbose
Enable verbose mode (currently just for \-W wakelock option). Not compatible
with the \-b brief option.
.TP
.B \-w
This uses fnotify to count the number of wakelock lock/unlocks. Lightweight
and simple wakelock monitoring.
.TP
.B \-W
This does deeper system call inspection to monitor wakelock usage and uses
up more run time processing to perform the inspection.
